### **Project Title:** Mini Telegram Demo

### **Description:**

This project is a simplified clone of the Telegram messaging application, built using **Java**, **JavaFX** for the graphical user interface, **SQLite** as the local database, and **Hibernate** for object-relational mapping (ORM). The project simulates basic messaging features in a standalone desktop environment to demonstrate the integration of modern Java technologies.

### **Goals:**

* Practice designing and implementing a layered Java application (UI, logic, and persistence).
* Gain hands-on experience with **JavaFX** for building desktop GUIs.
* Learn how to manage persistent data using **SQLite** and access it through **Hibernate ORM**.
* Understand the principles of user management (signup/login), conversations, and local message storage.
* Apply object-oriented design principles and best practices in a real-world-style application.

### **Collaborators:**

* Parsa Asadi
* Mohammad Javad Akbari
